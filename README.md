# Blog Assets and Examples

This repository contains supplementary material, code, and examples for my personal tech blog:

➡️ https://blog.krudewig-online.de

The content here is referenced across various posts and may include:

- **Code examples**
- **Configuration snippets**
- **Demo projects and experiments**
- **Diagrams, images, and other assets**

## Structure

The repository is organized to roughly mirror the structure of the blog posts. Directories and files are typically named after the corresponding article or topic.

## Usage

- **Reading along with the blog**:  
  Open the directory that matches the post you are reading and follow any instructions in its local `README` (if present).

- **Running code examples**:  
  Each example or project should contain its own setup instructions (e.g. `README`, comments in code, or configuration files).

To get started:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/chr1st1ank/blog-assets.git](https://github.com/chr1st1ank/blog-assets.git)
cd blog-assets
```
